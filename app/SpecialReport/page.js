                    <h5 className=" font-bold mb-4">Introduction</h5>
                    <p className=" text-[13px] mb-5 ">Violation of the right to liberty and security of person is one of the main challenges and concerns in Afghanistan under the de facto rule of Taliban. These detentions have led to an environment of terror and fear among Afghan citizens.</p>
                    <p className=" text-[13px] mb-5 ">According to the findings of Rawadari, Taliban have arbitrarily detained hundreds of Afghan citizens since August 2021. Many of these individuals were employees of the previous government, especially employees of security and defense institutions. Taliban have also arrested dozens of civil society activists, journalists and human rights defenders for demanding justice and criticizing the existing situation. Taliban have further subjected some of the detainees to violence & abuse. Taliban have also arrested and detained hundreds of other individuals on the charges of “collaboration with and membership of the National Resistance Front” along with dozens of protesting women & some members of the Salafi sect.</p>
                    <p className=" text-[13px] mb-5 ">The findings of Rawadari indicate that Taliban have arbitrarily and illegally arrested and detained officials of the previous government as well as protestors and critics to either exert revenge or suppress any civil opposition.</p>
                    <p className=" text-[13px] mb-7 ">The deterrent legal mechanisms that prevent such abuses and hold its perpetrators accountable are not in practice and have lost effectiveness in Afghanistan.</p>


                    <h5 className=" font-bold mb-4">Methodology</h5>
                    <p className=" text-[13px] mb-7 ">The data included in this report cover the period of 15 August 2021 to 15 November 2022, based on Rawadari’s monitoring and documentation in 29 provinces of Afghanistan. The provinces covered are the following: Kabul, Kandahar, Herat, Nangarhar, Bamiyan, Kunar, Uruzgan, Helmand, Badakhshan, Kunduz, Daikundi, Sar-e-pol, Takhar, Ghor, Maidan Wardak, Ghazni, Panjshir, Parwan, Baghlan, Khost, Paktia, Paktika, Farah, Nimruz, Badghis, Kapisa, Nuristan, Laghman and Balkh.</p>

                    <h5 className=" font-bold mb-4">Prohibition of Arbitrary and Illegal Detention in International Human Rights Treaties</h5>
                    <p className=" text-[13px] mb-5 ">International Human Rights Treaties recognizes and guarantees the Right to Liberty and Security of Person to all individuals. Article 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the United Nations on the 10th December 1948 stipulates “No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile”</p>
                    <p className=" text-[13px] mb-5 ">Similarly, it is stated in sub article 1 of Article 9 of the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 16th December 1966 that “Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention. No one shall be deprived of his/her liberty except on such grounds and in accordance with such procedure as are established by law”.</p>
                    <p className=" text-[13px] mb-7 ">Depriving individuals from the Right to Liberty is only legitimate when it takes place in accordance to law and authorized by competent authorities. Any illegal and arbitrary action in this regard is considered violation of the provisions of the mentioned laws and clear violation of human rights. The current report examines these violations from 15 August 2021 to 15 November 2022 in Afghanistan.</p>

                    <h5 className=" font-bold mb-4">Report Description</h5>
                    <p className=" text-[13px] mb-5 ">Based on our findings, Taliban have illegally and arbitrarily arrested and detained at least 1976 persons in 29 provinces of Afghanistan between 15 August 2021 and 15 November 2022, including 1836 men, 136 women and 4 children. Those detained mainly include previous government’s employees, women protestors, human rights defenders, civil society activists, journalists, religious scholars, members of Salafi sect, tribal elders and civilians accused of being associated with National Resistance Front (NRF).</p>
                    <p className=" text-[13px] mb-5 ">The absolute majority of these arrests were made by the Directorate of Intelligence of Taliban, however, other departments and individuals such as municipalities and police units, and the Department of Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice and district governors have also played a role in arresting and detaining individuals.</p>
                    <p className=" text-[13px] mb-5 ">The Taliban illegally and arbitrarily detained at least 1976 persons across Afghanistan, 136 women and 4 children.</p>
                    <p className=" text-[13px] mb-5 ">These arbitrary detentions are happening in a legal vacuum where the citizens are not aware which previous laws (laws in effect during the Republic) are being upheld and what laws have been permanently abolished. This in addition to sweeping replacements in judges and attorneys across the country from the previous cadre to Taliban members has contributed to a major legal vacuum and a sense of lawlessness.</p>
                    <p className=" text-[13px] mb-5 ">To our knowledge currently no human rights organization has regular, unannounced monitoring access to places of detention in Afghanistan. Thus, Rawadari is extremely concerned about the current situation in prisons and treatment of detainees.</p>
                    <p className=" text-[13px] mb-5 ">We also acknowledge that due to the restrictions in access to information, the number of individuals in arbitrary detention might be higher compared to the data included in this report.</p>
